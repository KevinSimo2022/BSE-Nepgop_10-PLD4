Planning and Design: The first step in creating a website is to plan and design it. Decide on the features and functionality you want to include, and create a wireframe or mockup of the website.

Setup Flask Web Framework: Flask is a Python web framework that can be used to create web applications. Install Flask using pip and set up a basic Flask application.

Create Database: Create a SQL database to store the information about the houses, landlords, and tenants. You can use 
SQLite or any other SQL database of your choice.

Create User Authentication: Create a user authentication system to allow landlords and tenants to sign up and log in to the website. You can use Flask-Login or any other authentication library of your choice.

Create House Listings: Create a form to allow landlords to add their house listings to the database. The form should include information such as the location, price, number of bedrooms, and any other relevant details.

Create Search Functionality: Create a search functionality that allows tenants to search for houses based on various criteria, such as location, price, and number of bedrooms.

Create Bookings: Allow tenants to book houses that they are interested in. The booking process should include a calendar that shows the availability of the house and a form for tenants to provide their details and payment information.

Integration with Google Maps: Integrate Google Maps to show the location of the houses on a map.

Host the website: Host the website on a server, either locally or on a web hosting service, and make it publicly accessible.

Overall, building a website in Python for house renting opportunities in Rwanda for students with Python and SQL features is a complex task that requires a good understanding of web development and database management. You will need to use various libraries and frameworks, such as Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Google Maps API, to create a fully functional website.
